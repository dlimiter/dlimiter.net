    Hi, my name is Dave. I’m a Melbourne based software engineer and amateur creative and this is where I ramble on about things I find interesting and inspiring. It’s a kind of chaos, but hopefully good chaos.

    <p>
      In my day job I earn my keep as a Web & Software Developer & have crafted from a variety of materials including Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Fusion, Ruby, Rails, and Perl. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      I believe that good software should be both beautiful & easy to use. Simplicity is the key to both of these things & it is worth the extra effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time (har har) I am a father, a (very) amateur juggler & volunteer at <a href="http://rrr.org.au">Three Triple R FM</a>.
    </p> 
    <p>I love cooking, reading, writing, drawing, painting, movies, games, card magic, sci-fi, volunteering & about a hundred other things. I look forward to spending more time doing them as soon as I figure out how to warp space-time to make my days long enough.
